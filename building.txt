BUILDING
--------

To build the MIDI-CTRL framework, you will need access to a Unix
environment and a Java compiler. These are available under MacOSX and
Linux. To build the framework under Windows, you can use the Cygwin
environment.

Under MacOSX, you will need to have the XCode tools installed, as well
as the compatibility framework to build 10.4u universal binaries
(which you can download from apple's developer site , where it is
called "10.4.0 Mac OS SDK") .

1. Create a new directory that will contain the sourcecode and the
binary tools contained in the framework.

$ mkdir midi-ctrl
$ cd midi-ctrl
$
2. Download the source from github

Use git to clone the git repository at github.com/wesen/mididuino
. For more information about the git source control system, visit
git-scm.com .

$ git clone git://github.com/wesen/mididuino.git

3. Getting the distribution package

The MIDI-CTRL frameworks needs a working avr-gcc toolchain to compile
binaries. Due to its size, this toolchain is hosted separately from
the mididuino sourcecode, and is available at
ruinwesen.com/support-files/mididuino-dist.tar.gz . This archive
contains the toolchains for MacOSX and Windows. Linux users will have
to build the toolchain on their own (additional documentation about
the process will be added here).

$ wget http://ruinwesen.com/support-files/mididuino-dist.tar.gz
$ tar zxvf mididuino-dist.tar.gz
x mididuino-dist/
x mididuino-dist/macosx/
x mididuino-dist/shared/
x mididuino-dist/windows/
x mididuino-dist/windows/avr_tools.zip
x mididuino-dist/windows/bootloader/
x mididuino-dist/windows/core/
x mididuino-dist/windows/cygiconv-2.dll
x mididuino-dist/windows/cygwin1.dll
x mididuino-dist/windows/ICE_JNIRegistry.dll
x mididuino-dist/windows/jikes.exe
...

4. Build the MIDI-CTRL environment (MacOSX)

Now that all the files are there, build the MIDI-CTRL environment:

$ cd mididuino/build/macosx/
$ ./clean.sh
$ ./dist.sh
Creating MidiCtrl distribution for revision 0017...

The environment is now available in the file midictrl-XXX.dmg .
