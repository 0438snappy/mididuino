MIDI-CTRL Framework
-------------------

The MIDI-CTRL Framework is the framework running on the MiniCommand
devices by Ruin & Wesen. Information about the devices as well as
usage of the framework can be found at http://ruinwesen.com/

It contains code to:

- control the hardware (LCD, encoders, buttons, MIDI interface, SD card)
- handle the MIDI inputs and the MIDI output
- general data structures and algorithms (stack, callbacks, vectors,
  ring buffers, etc...)
- create GUIs (using sketches, pages, modal pages, event handlers)
- handle FAT32 storage (thanks to the library by Roland Riegel)
- interface with the Elektron MachineDrum and MonoMachine
- create musical algorithms (sequencer, euclid rhythm generation,
  arpeggiator)
- a big collection of firmwares and tutorials

Further information, as well as a wiki, forums and an issue tracker
